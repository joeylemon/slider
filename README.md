A mobile app to calibrate a poker chip launching device.

## The Project
This was a part of the final project for EF 151 at the University of Tennessee. We were tasked with completing the follows:
- Building a device capable of launching a poker chip into designated areas on a workshop table
- Creating a program to output calibrations for our device to shoot towards said areas
- Scoring the most amount of points in a 2.5 minute period

## Our Device
Our device consisted of a base plate and a tube which held a spring. The tube had pin holes at various locations to deflect the spring and store elastic energy. The base plate also had pin holes to aim the tube at a specific angle.

## The App
The app took all of the project requirements and put them into a user-friendly interface. In order to calibrate the device, the user simply needed to tap the area he/she wanted to shoot the chip towards.
